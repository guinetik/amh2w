# AMH2W - All My Homies ~~Hate~~ Handle Windows

A minimal but expressive PowerShell utility library that lets you write commands like a sentence and treat errors like data.

---

## ‚ö° What It Does

AMH2W is not just a meme‚Äîit's a shell DSL where every word maps to a namespace or action:

```powershell
all my homies hate json tree "https://api.example.com/data"
```

That line? It parses JSON from a URL and prints it as a tree.

Need system info?

```powershell
all my uptime
```

Install a CLI tool?

```powershell
all my homies install chocolatey
```

Launch a browser?

```powershell
all my browser google.com
```

It's declarative, it's composable, it's readable, and it's built for scripting and debugging real-world Windows environments.

---

## üß† Conceptual Model: Namespaces as Grammar

AMH2W was born out of two personal needs:

1. **To organize the chaos** ‚Äî Like many devs, I had a mess of random PowerShell scripts strewn across projects, downloads folders, and forgotten Notepad++ tabs. AMH2W gives them a home ‚Äî a clean, reusable hierarchy that makes scripting feel good.
2. **To rebel** ‚Äî Against the tyranny of `Get-Verbosity`, `Set-Tedium`, `Invoke-Overkill`. PowerShell's default grammar is a bureaucratic fever dream. AMH2W throws that out and replaces it with something human: `all my homies hate windows`. Minimal, memetic, memorable.

Yes, it's ironic. Yes, it's inspired by internet culture. But also ‚Äî it works.


Commands are structured like sentences. Each word is a layer of meaning:

- **`all`** ‚Äî The root of everything. This bootstraps the command grammar and resolves modules.
- **`my`** ‚Äî User-focused commands: uptime, shell access, browser launching.
- **`homies`** ‚Äî Extended utility layer. These are your tools, integrations, and contacts.
- **`hate`** ‚Äî The "adapter" that simplifies complexity: it makes things like JSON parsing or Windows telemetry easy to talk to.
- **`windows`** ‚Äî Everything Windows-related: telemetry, cleanup, versioning.
- **`json`** ‚Äî A power-tool for working with structured data interactively.

You get a grammar tree like:

```powershell
all my homies hate json tree
```
Which breaks down into:
- `all` ‚Äî core
- `my` ‚Äî personal context
- `homies` ‚Äî utility toolkit
- `hate` ‚Äî adapter for simplified interaction
- `json` ‚Äî specific module (with `view`, `tree`, `table`, etc.)

This isn't just clever naming‚Äîit makes discoverability and chaining commands intuitive.
The point is to create a grammar-like syntax that is easy to remember and easy to use.

## üß± Architecture

- `core/`: Logging, result types, parser, pipeline support
- `all/`: All commands start here. Math and weather functions.
- `all/my/`: User-centric tools (`clock`, `uptime`, `files`, `shell`, etc)
- `all/my/homies/`: Utilities, downloaders, nested namespaces
- `hate/`: Verbosity-simplifying adapter (e.g. `json`, `windows`)
- `install/`: Installers like `choco`

---

## üß† Writing Your Own Commands

You define a `.ps1` in the appropriate namespace folder (like `all/my/homies/hello.ps1`) and export a function matching its path. Your function should:

- Return `Ok` or `Err` objects
- Use `Log-Info`, `Log-Warning`, or `Log-Error`
- Respect pipeline input if possible

> üöß Work-in-progress CLI scaffolder:

```powershell
all -Create "say hello" "echo 'Hello World'"
```

---

## ‚ùå Exception-Free Zone

No `throw`. Only structured `Result` objects.

```powershell
return Ok -Value "done"
return Err "failed"
return Err -Msg "optional warning" -Optional $true
```
