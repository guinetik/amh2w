# AMH2W - All My Homies ~~Hate~~ Handle Windows

A minimal but expressive PowerShell utility library that lets you write commands like a sentence and treat errors like data.

---

## ‚ö° What It Does

AMH2W is not just a meme‚Äîit's a shell DSL where every word maps to a namespace or action:

```powershell
all my homies hate json tree "https://api.example.com/data"
```
That line? It parses JSON from a URL and prints it as a tree.

Need system info?

```powershell
all my homies hate windows wineofetch
```

Install a CLI tool?

```powershell
all my homies install chocolatey
```

Launch a browser?

```powershell
all my browser google.com
```

It's declarative, it's composable, it's readable, and it's built for scripting and debugging real-world Windows environments.

## üéØ Features

- **Natural command chaining** via nested namespaces like `all my homies`
- **Result pattern** for `Ok`/`Err`-based error handling
- **Unwrapping** of results for easy use
- **Built in pipeline** for easy chaining of commands in a safe way
- **Built-in logging system** with severity levels
- **Modular structure** for clean extensions
- **Pipeline-aware execution** like `result | map { it }`
---

## üì¶ Installation

### Pre-requisites

- PowerShell 5.1+
- Works better with PowerShell Core (pwsh)
- .NET 4.0+
- Windows 7+
- Administrator privileges

Before installing make sure you have the appropriate execution policy set:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Download and install the latest release:
```powershell
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://github.com/guinetik/amh2w/releases/latest/download/amh2w.ps1'))
```

Or if you want a single command:
```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -Command "Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://github.com/guinetik/amh2w/releases/latest/download/amh2w.ps1'))"
```

(Replace `pwsh` with `powershell` if you are using Windows PowerShell)

### Locally Install:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/guinetik/amh2w.git
cd amh2w
./install.ps1
. $PROFILE
```

```
' ', '.', ':', '-', '=', '+', '*', '#', '%', '@'
```

When using `-Invert`, this order is reversed.

#### Examples

```powershell
# Convert a photo to ASCII art
all my homies luv ascii "C:\Users\You\Pictures\photo.jpg"

# Create a large ASCII version for a presentation
all my homies luv ascii "./company-logo.png" -Width 150

# Invert for dark terminal backgrounds
all my homies luv ascii "./icon.gif" -Width 60 -Invert
```

#### Technical Notes

- Uses .NET System.Drawing for image processing
- Automatically calculates height to maintain aspect ratio
- Converts to grayscale by averaging RGB values
- Maps brightness values to ASCII characters

### üé¨ Terminal Animations

#### The Matrix Effect
```powershell
# Start the classic Matrix digital rain animation
all my homies luv thematrix
```

Features:
- Full-screen Matrix-style digital rain effect
- Green text on black background
- Infinite loop animation (press Ctrl+C to stop)
- Uses the word "MATRIX" as the falling characters
- Adapts to your terminal window size

### üõ∞Ô∏è International Space Station Tracker

Track the ISS in real-time with detailed information and crew data:

#### Usage
```powershell
# Get current ISS position
all my homies luv iss position

# Track ISS in real-time with updates every 5 seconds
all my homies luv iss track

# Get current crew information
all my homies luv iss crew

# Get upcoming ISS passes over your location
all my homies luv iss pass

# Show ISS on a world map
all my homies luv iss map

# Get help
all my homies luv iss help
```

#### Features
- **Real-time Position**: Live latitude/longitude coordinates
- **Location Names**: Reverse geocoding to show what country/region the ISS is over
- **Crew Information**: Current astronauts aboard the ISS
- **Pass Predictions**: When the ISS will be visible from your location
- **Visual Tracking**: ASCII world map showing ISS position relative to your location
- **Caching**: Smart caching for offline functionality
- **Auto-location**: Uses your IP to determine your location automatically

#### Examples
```powershell
# Basic position check
all my homies luv iss position

# Track with custom update interval (10 seconds)
all my homies luv iss track -UpdateInterval 10

# Use specific location coordinates
all my homies luv iss track -Location "40.7128,-74.0060"  # New York City
```

## üß† Conceptual Model: Commands as Grammar

AMH2W was born out of two personal needs:

1. **To organize the chaos** ‚Äî Like many devs, I had a mess of random PowerShell scripts strewn across projects, downloads folders, and forgotten Notepad++ tabs. AMH2W gives them a home ‚Äî a clean, reusable hierarchy that makes scripting feel good.
2. **To rebel** ‚Äî Against the **tyranny** of `Get-Verbosity`, `Set-Tedium`, `Invoke-Overkill`. PowerShell's default grammar is a bureaucratic *Orwellian* nightmare. AMH2W throws that out and replaces it with something human: `all my homies hate windows`. Minimal, memetic, memorable.

Yes, it's ironic. Yes, it's inspired by internet culture. But also ‚Äî it works.


Commands are structured like sentences. Each word is a layer of meaning:

- **`all`** ‚Äî The root of everything. This bootstraps the command grammar and resolves modules.
- **`my`** ‚Äî User-focused commands: uptime, shell access, browser launching.
- **`homies`** ‚Äî Extended utility layer. These are your tools, integrations, and contacts.
- **`hate`** ‚Äî The "adapter" that simplifies complexity: it makes things like JSON parsing or Windows telemetry easy to talk to.
- **`windows`** ‚Äî Everything Windows-related: telemetry, cleanup, versioning.
- **`json`** ‚Äî A power-tool for working with structured data interactively.

You get a grammar tree like:

```powershell
all my homies hate json tree
```
Which breaks down into:
- `all` ‚Äî core
- `my` ‚Äî personal context
- `homies` ‚Äî utility toolkit
- `hate` ‚Äî adapter for simplified interaction
- `json` ‚Äî specific module (with `view`, `tree`, `table`, etc.)

This isn't just clever naming‚Äîit makes discoverability and chaining commands intuitive.
The point is to create a grammar-like syntax that is easy to remember and easy to use.

## üß± Architecture

- `core/`: Logging, result types, parser, pipeline support
- `all/`: All commands start here. Math and weather functions.
- `all/my/`: User-centric tools (`clock`, `uptime`, `files`, `shell`, etc)
- `all/my/homies/`: Utilities, downloaders, nested namespaces
- `hate/`: Verbosity-simplifying adapter (e.g. `json`, `windows`)
- `install/`: Installers like `choco`

---

## üß† Writing Your Own Commands

You define a `.ps1` in the appropriate namespace folder (like `all/my/homies/hello.ps1`) and export a function matching its path. Your function should:

- Return `Ok` or `Err` objects
- Use `Log-Info`, `Log-Warning`, or `Log-Error`
- Respect pipeline input if possible

> üöß Work-in-progress CLI scaffolder:

```powershell
all -Create "say hello" "echo 'Hello World'"
```

---

## ‚ùå Exception-Free Zone

No `throw`. Only structured `Result` objects.

```powershell
return Ok -Value "done"
return Err "failed"
return Err -Message "optional warning" -Optional $true
```
